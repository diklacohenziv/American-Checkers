   or another human upponent. In case of another human uponent, the user will

4. At each stage, the player will be asked to enter his 'move' by this format: 
   COLrow>COLrow (i.e. Af>Be)
6. If the move is 'illegal', the user will be prompted to enter a valid move.
7. After a valid move was entered by the user, the screen will be cleared and the
   board will be re-drawn with the new state.
